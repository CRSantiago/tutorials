    "This tutorial is not only to help you ramp up on Fugue, but more importantly, it helps you better understand the basic concepts of distributed computing, from higher level. The philosophy of Fugue is to **adapt to you**, so as long as you understand the basic concepts, you can simply use Fugue to express or glue your logic. Most of your code will stay in native python."
