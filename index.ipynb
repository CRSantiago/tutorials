    "# Welcome To Fugue Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment has everything setup for you, you can run Fugue on native python, Spark and Dask, with Fugue SQL support. In order to setup your own environment, you can pip install the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install fugue[all]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to run the tutorial is to use [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fugue-project/tutorials/master)\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fugue-project/tutorials/master)\n",
    "\n",
    "**BUT please notice that, it runs slow on binder, the spark initialization can take a long time, it should be a single core virtual machine**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tutorials environment on your own machine, the simplest way is, if you have docker installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 fugueproject/tutorials:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run docker on your own machine, the performance should be a lot better.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is not only to help you ramp up on Fugue, but more importantly, it helps you better understand the basic concepts of distributed computing, from higher level. The philosophy of Fugue is to **adapt to you**, so as long as you understand the basic concepts, you can simply use Fugue to express or glue your logic. Most of your code will stay in native python."

    "# Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics will follow the architecture from bottom up, from the most basic abstraction elements to the most abstract layers.\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/architecture.svg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## [1. Hello World](#Hello-World)\n",
    "How to quickly start playing with Fugue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [2. Data Type, Schema & DataFrames](tutorials/schema_dataframes.ipynb)\n",
    "Fugue data types and schema are strictly based on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html). Dataframe is an abstract concept with several built in implementations to adapt to different dataframes. In this tutorial, we will go through the basic APIs and focus on the most common use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [3. Partition](tutorials/partition.ipynb)\n",
    "This tutorial is more focused on explaining the basic ideas of data partition. It's less related with Fugue. To have a good understanding of partition is the key to writing high performance code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [4. Execution Engine](tutorials/execution_engine.ipynb)\n",
    "The heart of Fugue. It is the layer that unifies many of the core concepts of distributed computing, and separates the underlying computing frameworks from users' higher level logic. Normally you don't directly operate on execution engines. But it's good to understand some basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [5. Execution Graph (DAG) & Programming Interface](tutorials/dag.ipynb)\n",
    "The most important tutorial you should read. In this tutorial, we will focus on how to use the APIs to construct your own workflow. In this tutorial we will also have some basic examples of extensions, for more examples, please read the next topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [6. Extensions](tutorials/extensions.ipynb)\n",
    "The second most important tutorial you should read. It covers all types of extensions you can customize.\n",

    "The most useful extension, that is widely used in real world. **PLEASE READ**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [7. Fugue SQL](tutorials/sql.ipynb)\n",
    "The most fun part of Fugue. You can use SQL instead of python to represent the backbone of your workflow, and you can keep you mindset in SQL in most of the time and with the help of python extensions. The SQL mindset is great for distributed computing, you may be able to make your logic more scale agnostic if within SQL mindset. In this tutorial, we will cover all syntax of Fugue SQL.\n",
