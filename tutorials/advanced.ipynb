    "\n",
    "Since you already have much experience in Spark and distributed computing in general, you may be interested more in the extra values Fugue can add.\n",

    "## 1. Architecture & Hello World\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/architecture.svg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a [Hello World](#Hello-World) example\n",

    "\n",
    "## [2. COVID19 Data Exploration](example_covid19.ipynb)\n",
    "*If you are against SQL, please skip 2 and 3. There is a complete guide on the programming interface.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's firstly see an example how Fugue SQL is used in data exploration. Fugue SQL is a new way to express your end to end workflow. It's almost equivalent to the programming interface but the way you express will actually affect the way you think. So for many cases, the SQL mindset maybe helpful to build platform and scale agnostic pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [3. Fugue SQL](sql.ipynb)\n",
    "The most fun part of Fugue. You can use SQL instead of python to represent the backbone of your workflow, and you can keep you mindset in SQL in most of the time and with the help of python extensions. In this tutorial, we will cover all syntax of Fugue SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [4. Stock Sentiment Analysis (Preprocessing)](stock_sentiment.ipynb)\n",
    "A Fugue use case in NLP preprocessing. You can get a sense of how Fugue works, and why we want to Fugue layer but not directly on Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [5. Execution Graph (DAG) & Programming Interface](dag.ipynb)\n",
    "A deep dive on the programming interfaces we used on the sentiment analysis. In this tutorial we will cover most features of the Fugue programming interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [6. Extensions](extensions.ipynb)\n",
    "From the previous tutorials you have seen plenty of extension examples, here is a complete guide to use Fugue extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Transformer](transformer.ipynb) (MUST READ)\n",
    "The most useful extension, that is widely used in real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [CoTransformer](cotransformer.ipynb)\n",
    "Transformation on multiple dataframes partitioned in the same way\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Creator](creator.ipynb)\n",
    "Creators of dataframes for a DAG to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Processor](processor.ipynb)\n",
    "Taking in one or multiple dataframes and produce a single dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Outputter](outputter.ipynb)\n",
    "Taking in one or multiple dataframes to do final jobs such as save and print\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Deep Dive\n",
    "It's time to build a systematic understanding of Fugue architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Data Type, Schema & DataFrames](schema_dataframes.ipynb)\n",
    "Fugue data types and schema are strictly based on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html). Dataframe is an abstract concept with several built in implementations to adapt to different dataframes. In this tutorial, we will go through the basic APIs and focus on the most common use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Partition](partition.ipynb) (MUST READ)\n",
    "This tutorial is more focused on explaining the basic ideas of data partition. It's less related with Fugue. To have a good understanding of partition is the key to writing high performance code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Execution Engine](execution_engine.ipynb)\n",
    "The heart of Fugue. It is the layer that unifies many of the core concepts of distributed computing, and separates the underlying computing frameworks from users' higher level logic. Normally you don't directly operate on execution engines. But it's good to understand some basics.\n",

    "### [Fugue Configurations](useful_config.ipynb) (MUST READ)\n",
    "The heart of Fugue. It is the layer that unifies many of the core concepts of distributed computing, and separates the underlying computing frameworks from users' higher level logic. Normally you don't directly operate on execution engines. But it's good to understand some basics.\n",
