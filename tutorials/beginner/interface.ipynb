    "To illustrate the first two painpoints above, we'll use a simple code example on a DataFrame with 2 string columns (*col1* and *col2*). This following operation will not make sense, but will show how Pandas and Spark syntactically differ.  We're will create a new column (*col3*). This third column with be a concatenation of the first column with the first 3 letters second column. This whole value will then be reversed. We will execute this logic on Pandas and Spark."
